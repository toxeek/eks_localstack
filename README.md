# eks_localstack
localstack based eks module.

## REQUIREMENTS
You will need localstack configured with the mock keys and ready to run. As this uses EKS, you need to purchase at least the Developer version of localstac which is super cheap, and mocking aws locally rocks. Please refer to the localstack GitHub for installation, etc: ![alt text](https://github.com/localstack/localstack "localstack")
