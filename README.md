# eks_localstack
localstack based eks module.

## REQUIREMENTS
You will need localstack configured with the mock keys and ready to run. As this uses EKS, **YOU WILL NEED TO PURCHASE AT LEAST THE DEVELOPER VERSION OF LOCALSTACK**, which is super cheap, and mocking aws locally rocks. Please refer to the localstack GitHub for installation, etc: [localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack)

You will need to have the aws-iam-authenticator tool installed in your system, and the aws cli. We use the iam authenticator to create a local kubeconfig file using the aws cli. So after you provision the cluster, install [the aws iam authenticator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-aws-iam-authenticator.html) and aws cli. At this point, the user / role used to create the cluster is added to the system:master group in eks. So to install the aws-iam-authenticator, you can do it such as:
```bash
$ sudo curl -o /usr/bin/aws-iam-authenticator https://amazon-eks.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.21.2/2021-07-05/bin/darwin/amd64/aws-iam-authenticator && chmod +x /usr/bin/aws-iam-authenticator
```

It is now that you can write the local kubeconfig file using for example, the aws cli:
```bash
aws eks --region region update-kubeconfig --name cluster_name
```
You'd need to change the **region** and **cluster_name** for your setup.

## PROVISIONING THE CLUSTER
To provision this cluster and add ons, remember this is done with localstack and with the special provider for aws we setup to use it (localstack). This should be transparent, so you can safely issue the next commands to have it all running in your localstack mock setup:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/toxeek/eks_localstack.git
$ cd eks_localstack
$ make init # this is idempotent, you can run init many times
$ make update # not necessary on for 1st run
$ make plan
$ make apply
```
As you see above, we use a Makefile and its targets as a wrapper to install the eks infrastructure. The targets of the Makefile areÂ¨:
1. **init**: initialises the tf code
2. **update**: updates the modules used
3. **plan**: does a terraform plan outputing to a local .tfstate file
4. **apply**: applies the tf code in the .tfstate file created by the plan target
5. **clean**: cleans up the local tf setup (.terraform and .tfstate file)
6. **destroy**: does a terraform destroy of the eks setup

In this case, we create our own vpc, but you can use the terraform remote state, and use an existing vpc (you'll need to change the code). You use remote states whenever you want to run code in existing infrastrcuture so make as many changes as you like.
